# Downshift Hooks

Every React hook offers custom logic to build the kind of dropdown you need. If
you need to build a **combobox** then use [useCombobox](/use-combobox).

However, if you don't need to type a search query and just have a dropdown that
is actioned by a button (a **select**, basically), then use
[useSelect](/use-select).

If you need to add multiple selection for any of them and have the selected
items act as a Tag List next to the _select_ or _combobox_, then
[useMultipleSelection](/use-multiple-selection) is the right tool for that.

## Breaking Changes in v7

Since version 7, the _useSelect_ and _useCombobox_ hooks to support the ARIA 1.2
pattern for the combobox, which contains some changes from the ARIA 1.1 pattern.
This brings changes in the API and the behaviour of _useCombobox_, detailed in
the
[migration page](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift/blob/master/src/hooks/MIGRATION_V7.md).
