# Downshift Docs

Repository that hosts the Downshift Docsite. All Downshift examples should be hosted here, along with links to their Codesandbox equivalents, which should be hosted on the [examples repository](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift-examples).

## Develop

```sh
npm install

npm run serve
```

This will start the `docusaurus` app in development mode.


## Contribute

A great opportunity is to have all the sandboxes of the examples from this docsite in the examples repository. Also to have all examples from the examples repository hosted on the docsite as well.
